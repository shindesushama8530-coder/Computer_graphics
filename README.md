The helicopter flying project is a simple computer graphics program made in the C language. In this project, a helicopter is shown flying from one building to another using a for loop. The background has buildings, a moon, trees, and houses, made using basic shapes like lines, circles, bars, and ellipses.

To start the graphics, we use the initgraph() function from the graphics.h header file.
Computer graphics are an important part of real-life applications â€” we see them in TV, newspapers, weather reports and hospitals.
They help us understand information easily because "a picture is worth a thousand words".
